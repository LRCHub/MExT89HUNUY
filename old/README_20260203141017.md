[00:07.48] Writing the unwritten
[00:09.72] We're here facing the unknown
[00:14.14] 'Cause time is always tickin'
[00:16.33] With these scars we proudly show
[00:20.94] Looking up above me (Ooh)
[00:22.52] Skies are dark and cloudy (Ooh)
[00:24.35] But beyond that silver lining
[00:26.19] I know lies my fate
[00:30.21] Waiting for me
[00:37.21] 
[00:35.08] Nowhere to run, we wouldn't if there was one
[00:38.09] I hear the sound, a symphony from the crowd
[00:41.76] A thousand strong, they're chanting at me, hear them shouting
[00:45.24] "You are not alone"
[00:47.49] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[00:54.54] Go for gold, ooh (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[01:13.54] 
[01:01.52] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[01:06.09] Go on light up the darkness
[01:08.26] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
[01:12.63] Follow where your heart is
[01:14.72] We will not wave, we'll never change
[01:18.34] Under the pressure we maintain
[01:21.58] Stay gold, ooh (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[01:28.54] Stay gold
[01:33.04] 
[01:29.58] 僕は駆け上がるよ
[01:32.05] 君が望むなら
[01:36.34] 目を覚ました lion
[01:38.59] 逃すことはもう無い
[01:43.49] いつかの光 (Ooh) 共に背負い (Ooh)
[01:46.75] 未知なる高みを
[01:48.45] 追いかけて
[01:52.42] 鼓動のまま飛べ
[01:55.92] 
[01:57.13] ひたすら僕ら目指すんだ
[02:00.37] 限りなく燃える火は extra
[02:03.95] 手招く景色 僕ら何処へ
[02:07.26] 連れてくんだろう
[02:09.91] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:16.46] Go for gold, ooh (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:35.46] 
[02:23.50] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:28.19] 導く僕ら
[02:30.37] Stay gold (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:34.78] 何処までも行くんだ
[02:37.28] 理屈なんて 何もいらない
[02:40.52] 心は既に知ってるから
[02:43.92] Stay gold, ooh (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:51.17] Stay gold
[02:52.26] (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[02:58.84] (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[03:04.77] We will not wave, we'll never change
[03:07.92] Under the pressure we maintain
[03:11.46] Stay gold, ooh (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
[03:18.58] Stay gold
