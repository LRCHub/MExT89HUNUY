[00:06.82] Writing the unwritten
[00:09.30] We are here facing the unknown
[00:13.43] 'Cause time is always ticking
[00:16.12] With these scars we proudly show
[00:20.41] Looking up above me
[00:22.07] Skies are dark and cloudy
[00:23.78] But beyond that silver lining, I know lies my fate
[00:29.93] Waiting for me
[00:34.39] Nowhere to run
[00:35.71] We wouldn't if there was one
[00:37.84] I hear the sound
[00:39.12] A symphony from the crowd
[00:41.28] A thousand strong
[00:42.57] They're chanting at me, hear them shouting
[00:44.55] "You are not alone"
[00:46.95] Stay gold, oh
[00:53.90] Go for gold, oh
[01:00.76] Stay gold
[01:05.27] Go on, light up the darkness
[01:07.58] Stay gold
[01:12.08] Follow where your heart is
[01:14.44] We will not wave, we'll never change
[01:17.92] Under the pressure, we maintain
[01:21.18] Stay gold, oh
[01:28.13] Stay gold
[01:29.04] 僕は駆け上がるよ
[01:31.65] 君が望むなら
[01:35.89] 目を覚ました Lion
[01:38.48] 逃すことはもう無い
[01:42.79] いつかの光
[01:44.44] 共に背負い
[01:46.13] 未知なる高みを追いかけて
[01:51.95] 鼓動のまま 飛べ
[01:56.57] ひたすら 僕ら目指すんだ
[02:00.07] 限りなく 燃える火は Xtra
[02:03.48] 手招く景色 僕ら何処へ連れてくだろう
[02:09.26] Stay gold, oh
[02:16.18] Go for gold, oh
[02:22.95] Stay gold
[02:27.58] 導く僕ら
[02:29.89] Stay gold
[02:34.39] 何処までも行くんだ
[02:36.79] 理屈なんて 何もいらない
[02:40.23] 心は既に知っているから
[02:43.52] Stay gold, oh
[02:50.39] Stay gold
[03:04.24] We will not wave, we'll never change
[03:07.65] Under the pressure, we maintain
[03:10.95] Stay gold, oh
[03:17.88] Stay gold
